[ ] Add new function to reflow the text in left or right buffer to a new width
IMPORTANT:  The first line in each paragraph of the right buffer should
stay aligned with the same line in the left buffer if possible. 
The window size should be updated as well to keep the layout when resizing the .left buffer
Consider text properties for marking locations to align. 
reflow the text in whichever buffer the cursor is in (.left or .right)
