## Vim-Cleave Plugin Summary

Project: Complete vim plugin for splitting buffers vertically at cursor/column position

Status: Fully functional with all core features implemented

### Key Features Built:

   * :Cleave - Split buffer at cursor position into left/right windows
   * :CleaveAt <col> - Split at specific column
   * :CleaveUndo - Restore original buffer, close split windows
   * :CleaveJoin - Merge left/right buffers back to original with proper alignment

### Technical Implementation:

   * Architecture: Standard vim plugin structure (plugin/, autoload/, doc/)
   * Buffer management: Creates temporary .left and .right buffers
   * Window handling: Proper sizing including foldcolumn width
   * Content alignment: Right buffer content starts exactly at cleave column

### Files Created/Modified:

   * plugin/cleave.vim - Command definitions
   * autoload/cleave.vim - Core functionality
   * AGENT.md - Development guidelines
   * doc/cleave.txt - Documentation

### Recent Fixes:

   * Fixed buffer loading issues with bufload()
   * Proper content merging with padding
   * Silent buffer creation to suppress messages
   * Foldcolumn inheritance and window sizing

## Vim-Cleave Reflow Feature Implementation

âœ… Completed Implementation:

Added :CleaveReflow <width> command that reflows text in current cleaved buffer while preserving paragraph alignment between left/right buffers.

Key Features:

   * Auto-detects current buffer (.left or .right)
   * Reflows text to specified width with proper word wrapping
   * Maintains paragraph alignment using position mapping
   * Updates window sizing for left buffer reflows
   * Handles edge cases (minimum width, empty paragraphs)

Files Modified:

   * plugin/cleave.vim - Added CleaveReflow command
   * autoload/cleave.vim - Core reflow functions
   * doc/cleave.txt - Updated documentation
   * test/test_reflow.vim - Test suite

Core Algorithm:

   1. Map paragraphs between buffers before reflow
   2. Reflow current buffer text to new width
   3. Find new paragraph positions after reflow
   4. Realign other buffer paragraphs to maintain correspondence

Usage: Position cursor in left or right buffer, run :CleaveReflow 20 to reflow to 20 characters width.

Feature is complete and functional with proper paragraph alignment preservation.
