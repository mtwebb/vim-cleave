INTRODUCTION                                 *cleave-introduction*

Vim-cleave is a plugin that splits a buffer's content vertically at a
specified column, creating separate left and right buffers while maintaining
spatial positioning. This is particularly useful for editing files with
distinct left and right content, such as diffs, documentation with
annotations, or formatted text.

Key features:
- Buffer splitting at any column position
- Text reflow with paragraph alignment preservation
- Spatial preservation of cursor position and scrolling
- Intelligent paragraph boundary detection

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                     *cleave-commands*

*:CleaveAtCursor*
    Splits the current buffer at the cursor position. Creates two new buffers:
    - Left buffer: content from start of each line to cursor column
    - Right buffer: content from cursor column to end of each line
    
    The width of the new left window will be set to the cursor column.
    Both windows will have scroll binding enabled for synchronized scrolling.

*:CleaveAtColumn {column}*
    Splits the current buffer at the specified {column}. The width of the
    new left window will be set to {column}.
    
    Example: >
        :CleaveAtColumn 80
<
    This splits the buffer at column 80, useful for working with text that
    has a specific line length or format.

*:CleaveUndo*
    Restores the original buffer and closes the cleaved windows. This command
    discards any changes made to the split buffers and returns to the
    original buffer state.

*:CleaveJoin*
    Merges the left and right buffers back into the original buffer,
    maintaining proper alignment and spacing between the content. Changes
    made to either buffer are preserved in the merged result.
    
    The plugin calculates the necessary padding to maintain proper column
    alignment when joining the content.

*:CleaveReflow {width}*                      *cleave-reflow*
    Reflows the text in the current buffer (left or right) to the specified
    {width}. This command provides intelligent text wrapping while preserving
    the relationship between left and right content.

    Key features:
    - Automatically detects which cleaved buffer has focus
    - Preserves paragraph alignment between buffers
    - Maintains correspondence of paragraph positions across buffers
    - Updates window sizing automatically when reflowing the left buffer
    - Uses content-based matching to track paragraph positions
    - Handles both left and right buffer reflow with dedicated algorithms
    - Preserves original paragraph positioning when possible
    - Removes trailing whitespace during processing
    
    The algorithm works differently for left vs right buffers:
    
    For LEFT buffer reflow:
    1. Records paragraph positions in the RIGHT buffer
    2. Stores first words from LEFT buffer paragraphs for tracking
    3. Reflows the LEFT buffer text to new width
    4. Finds new paragraph positions by matching first words
    5. Realigns RIGHT buffer paragraphs to match new LEFT positions
    6. Updates window sizing to accommodate new LEFT buffer width
    
    For RIGHT buffer reflow:
    1. Identifies paragraph boundaries and content in RIGHT buffer
    2. Reflows each paragraph individually to new width
    3. Attempts to preserve original line positions when possible
    4. Ensures proper spacing between paragraphs
    5. LEFT buffer remains unchanged

    Minimum width: 10 characters
    
    Example: >
        :CleaveReflow 60
<
    This reflows the current buffer to 60 characters width while maintaining
    alignment with the corresponding buffer.

==============================================================================
OPTIONS                                      *cleave-options*

*g:cleave_gutter*
    Sets the number of spaces between the left and right content when joining
    buffers with `:CleaveJoin`. This affects the spacing calculation and
    determines how much padding is added between the left and right content
    in the merged result.

    Default: `3`
    
    Example: >
        let g:cleave_gutter = 5
<

EXAMPLES                                     *cleave-examples*

Basic workflow: >
    " Open a file with content to split
    :edit myfile.txt
    
    " Position cursor at column 40 and split
    40|
    :CleaveAtCursor
    
    " Or split at a specific column
    :CleaveAtColumn 80
    
    " Reflow the left buffer to 60 characters
    :CleaveReflow 60
    
    " Join the buffers back together
    :CleaveJoin
    
    " Or restore original buffer
    :CleaveUndo
<

Use cases:
- Documentation editing with side comments
- Code review with annotations
- Working with diff files
- Editing fixed-width data formats
- Formatting text with specific layouts

==============================================================================
