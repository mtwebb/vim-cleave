INTRODUCTION                                 *cleave-introduction*

Vim-cleave is a plugin that splits a buffer's content vertically at a
specified column, creating separate left and right buffers while maintaining
spatial positioning. This is useful for editing files with distinct left and
right sides, such as diffs or files with line numbers.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                     *cleave-commands*

*:Cleave*
    Splits the current buffer at the cursor position. The width of the new
    left window will be set to the cursor column.

*:CleaveAt {column}*
    Splits the current buffer at the specified {column}. The width of the
    new left window will be set to {column}.

*:CleaveUndo*
    Restores the original buffer and closes the cleaved windows.

*:CleaveJoin*
    Merges the left and right buffers back into the original buffer,
    maintaining proper alignment and spacing between the content.

*:CleaveReflow {width}*
    Reflows the text in the current buffer (left or right) to the specified
    {width}. The plugin automatically detects which cleaved buffer has focus.
    Paragraph alignment is preserved between buffers - the first line of each
    paragraph in the right buffer stays aligned with the corresponding line
    in the left buffer. Window sizing is updated automatically when reflowing
    the left buffer.

    Minimum width: 10 characters

==============================================================================
OPTIONS                                      *cleave-options*

*g:cleave_auto_sync*
    When set to `v:true`, changes in one of the cleaved buffers will be
    reflected in the other. This is useful for keeping the buffers in sync
    while editing.

    Default: `v:false`
