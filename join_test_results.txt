Testing CleaveJoin spacing calculation...
PASS: Simple ASCII join
PASS: Short left line join
PASS: CJK character join

=== Debugging actual split/join behavior ===
Original: 'Hello World'
Split at column 7:
  Left: 'Hello ' (length: 6)
  Right: 'World' (length: 5)
Join calculation:
  Left length: 6
  Padding needed: 0
  Padding: ''
  Rejoined: 'Hello World'
PASS: Split/rejoin consistency

TestJoinSpacing: 4/4 tests passed
